Quote of the week: “Servant leadership...It’s the notion of being part of something bigger than yourself and
of making the people around you better. In our daily struggles to advance within an
organization, we sometimes forget that it’s actually more about...the people that are
around us.” - General Lori J. Robertson, USAF

The Air Force Song

Off we go into the wild blue yonder,  
Climbing high into the sun;  
Here they come zooming to meet our thunder,  
At ‘em now, Give 'em the gun!  
Down we dive, spouting our flame from under,  
Off with one helluva roar!  
We live in fame or go down in flame. Hey!  
Nothing'll stop the U.S. Air Force!  

Brilliant minds fashioned a crate of thunder,  
Sent it high into the blue;  
Valiant hands blasted the world asunder;  
How they lived God only knew!  
Boundless souls dreaming of skies to conquer  
Gave us wings, ever to soar!  
With scouts before and bombers galore. Hey!  
Nothing'll stop the U.S. Air Force!  

Here's a toast to the host  
Of those who love the vastness of the sky,  
To a friend we send a message of the brave who serve on high.  
We drink to those who gave their all of old,  
Then down we roar to score the rainbow's pot of gold.  
A toast to the host of those we boast, the U.S. Air Force!  

Off we go into the wild sky yonder,  
Keep the wings level and true;  
If you'd live to be a grey-haired wonder  
Keep the nose out of the blue!  
Fly to fight, guarding the nation's border,  
We'll be there, followed by more!  
In echelon we carry on.  
Oh, nothing'll stop the U.S. Air Force!  

— Robert MacArthur Crawford

The Space Force Song
We’re the mighty watchful eye,
Guardians beyond the blue,
The invisible front line,
Warfighters brave and true.
Boldly reaching into space,
There’s no limit to our sky.
Standing guard both night and day,
We’re the Space Force from on high.
